Got it—that flow makes total sense:

Customer pays upfront → job shows as green / funded → workers can accept → you release money → you keep 8%.

Your problem = “How do I build the website that does this?”

Let’s solve that in a way you can actually launch with $0, no fancy coding required.

⸻

Big picture: you do NOT need a “real app” yet

You can fake the whole thing with:
	•	One form where customers post a job
	•	One public page that shows “Paid, waiting for someone to accept” in green
	•	One group chat (WhatsApp / Telegram) where workers hang out
	•	Venmo / Cash App / Stripe link for payment

Once that works and you’re getting jobs, then you worry about a custom-coded site.

⸻

Option 1 – Easiest $0 MVP (Airtable + simple link)

🔧 Tools (all free tier)
	•	Airtable (database + forms + public view)
	•	Venmo / Cash App / Stripe payment link
	•	WhatsApp or Telegram group for workers

🧱 Step 1 – Make your “Tasks” database

In Airtable, create a new base called:
“CityTasks – Job Board” (or whatever name you choose)

Add fields:
	1.	Task ID (auto number)
	2.	Customer Name
	3.	Contact (phone/email)
	4.	Task Title (e.g., “Take 5 bags to curb”)
	5.	Task Description
	6.	Neighborhood / Borough
	7.	Offered Price ($)
	8.	Time Window (e.g., “Today 5–7 PM”)
	9.	Status (single select: Unpaid, Paid – Waiting, Assigned, Done)
	10.	Worker Name (who accepted it)
	11.	Paid? (checkbox or yes/no)

⸻

🧱 Step 2 – Create the customer “Post a Job” form

In Airtable:
	•	Create a Form View called “Customer Job Form”
	•	Include fields: Name, Contact, Task Title, Description, Neighborhood, Price, Time Window

At the bottom of the form, add a message like:

Step 2 – Pay securely to confirm your task
After submitting this form, please send payment of $[your price] to:
Venmo: @YourHandle
Cash App: $YourHandle
In the note, write: “Task + your name”

When they pay, you’ll see it in Venmo/Cash App.

⸻

🧱 Step 3 – Make the “Green, Paid Jobs” board

Create a Grid or Gallery View in Airtable called:
“Open Jobs – Paid Only”

Filter it to show only:
	•	Status = "Paid – Waiting"

Customize it so:
	•	Show: Task Title, Neighborhood, Price, Time Window
	•	Add a field “Badge” with formula like "🟢 Paid – Waiting"

Now click “Share view” → “Create shareable link”.

This gives you a public page link that shows all paid, waiting tasks with a little green icon.

That’s exactly your “green = funded jobs waiting for someone to accept” board.

⸻

🧱 Step 4 – Worker side: how they accept a job

Post the Open Jobs link in your worker group (WhatsApp / Telegram).

Workers:
	1.	Open the board
	2.	See: 🟢 Paid jobs
	3.	Message you: “I’ll take Task #12”

You:
	•	Go in Airtable
	•	Set Status = "Assigned"
	•	Put Worker Name = [Name]

Now it disappears from the public “Paid – Waiting” view automatically.

When they finish:
	•	You pay them via Cash App / Venmo
	•	Set Status = "Done"

You keep your 8%.

⸻

🧱 Step 5 – Wrap this in a simple free website

Use Wix free or Carrd free and make a 1-pager:

Sections:
	1.	Hero
“Post any small job. Someone nearby will help.”
Button: “Post a Job (Free)” → links to Airtable Form
	2.	How it works
	1.	Post your task (free)
	2.	Pay upfront (secure – we hold it)
	3.	Helper accepts
	4.	Job done → we pay them → we keep 8%
	3.	See Open Jobs (for helpers)
Button: “View Open Paid Tasks” → links to Airtable “Paid – Waiting” view
	4.	Join as Helper
Button: “Join our worker group” → WhatsApp/Telegram invite link

That’s your MVP platform.
No backend. No coding. Real money.

⸻

Option 2 – If you do want code later

When you’re ready to upgrade from Airtable to a real web app, the stack could be:
	•	Frontend: Next.js or React
	•	Backend: Supabase (you already know this world)
	•	Payments: Stripe or Lemon Squeezy for cards + webhook to mark jobs as “Paid”
	•	Auth: phone or email login for workers/customers

I can write that MVP for you when you’re there:
	•	Job model
	•	Payment integration
	•	“Green” paid state
	•	Worker accept button
	•	Payout tracking

But for now, do NOT wait for perfect code. Get:
	•	An Airtable form
	•	An Airtable board
	•	A free website page
	•	One worker group

…and get your first 3–5 jobs through it.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Write the exact text for your website sections, or
	•	Give you the Airtable field list formatted so you can just copy it, or
	•	Draft your WhatsApp/Telegram welcome message for helpers.
