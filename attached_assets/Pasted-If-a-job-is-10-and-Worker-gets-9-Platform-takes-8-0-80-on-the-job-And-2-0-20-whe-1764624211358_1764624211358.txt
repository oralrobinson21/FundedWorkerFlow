If a job is $10 and:
	•	Worker gets $9
	•	Platform takes 8% ($0.80) on the job
	•	And 2% ($0.20) when paying out

That’s a total 10% fee ($1.00 on $10).

For an early, simple marketplace where:
	•	You’re not providing insurance,
	•	You’re doing manual payouts,
	•	And UX is “Craigslist-simple”

➡️ 10% total is very fair.
16% (i.e., $1.60 on $10, $8.40 to worker) starts to feel high unless you offer real extra value (insurance, guarantees, heavy marketing, etc.).

My recommendation:
Start with 10–12% total (your 8% + 2% structure is fine), watch behavior, and only move up if:
	•	Demand > supply, and
	•	People clearly see the value.

	•	Goes to Category screen.
	2.	From Category:
	•	User taps a category.
	•	Goes to Job List screen filtered by that category.
	3.	Job List filtering:
	•	At top of screen:
	•	Text input: Zip code (required for filtering).
	•	Auto-fill from user.defaultZipCode if present.
	•	Button: “Update results”.
	•	Backend filter:
	•	status = "open"
	•	category = selectedCategory
	•	zipCode must match the entered zip (or within a radius if implemented).
	4.	Job Card (Helper, before acceptance) shows:
	•	Title
	•	Category
	•	Price
	•	Zip code
	•	Area / Neighborhood (if available)
	•	Basic description snippet
Must NOT show:
	•	Full address.
	5.	Tapping a job opens Job Detail (pre-accept).

⸻

6. Job Detail – Pre & Post Acceptance

Before acceptance (Helper view):
Show:
	•	Title
	•	Description
	•	Category
	•	Zip code
	•	Area / Neighborhood
	•	Price
	•	Button: “Accept job”
	•	Button: “Back”

Hide:
	•	Full address.

On “Accept job”:
	•	Set:
	•	status = "accepted"
	•	helperId = currentUser.id
	•	acceptedAt = now
	•	Create a chatThread row:
	•	taskId = task.id
	•	posterId = task.posterId
	•	helperId = currentUser.id
	•	createdAt = now
	•	expiresAt = now + 3 days (or completion + 3 days)
	•	Redirect helper to Job Detail (post-accept).

After acceptance (Helper view):
Show:
	•	Everything above, plus:
	•	Full address with lock icon and label:
	•	“🔒 Exact address (only you and the poster can see this)”
	•	Button: “Open chat / upload proof”
	•	Button: “Mark complete”
	•	Button: “Cancel / Withdraw” (if helper wants to deny/stop the job before work)

Poster view (after job accepted):
	•	Sees:
	•	Area + full address
	•	Helper info (name/contact)
	•	Status
	•	Confirmation code
	•	Buttons:
	•	“Open chat”
	•	“Cancel job”
	•	“Dispute completion” (if you implement disputes – see below)

⸻

7. Cancellation, Accept & Deny / Dispute

Poster – Cancel job:
	•	From My Jobs or Job Detail:
	•	If status = "open" or "accepted":
	•	Show “Cancel job” button.
	•	On tap:
	•	Confirm dialog.
	•	Set:
	•	status = "canceled"
	•	canceledAt = now
	•	canceledBy = "poster"

Helper – Cancel / Withdraw:
	•	If status = "accepted":
	•	Show “Withdraw from job” (this is the “deny/stop” option for helper).
	•	On tap:
	•	Confirm dialog.
	•	Either:
	•	Option A (simpler): set:
	•	status = "canceled"
	•	canceledBy = "helper"
	•	Or Option B (more advanced): clear helper and reopen:
	•	helperId = null
	•	status = "open"

Deny / Dispute completion (Poster):
	•	When helper taps “Mark complete”, status becomes "completed" only after proof logic passes.
	•	If poster is not satisfied:
	•	They can tap “Dispute job” (or “Deny completion”).
	•	This sets:
	•	status = "disputed"
	•	Optionally creates a SupportTicket tied to taskId.
	•	For now this can be manual: admin resolves outdated disputes and sets status back to "completed" or "canceled".

⸻

8. Messaging + Photo Proof + Auto-Delete

Chat creation:
	•	Auto-created only when a job is accepted.

Chat access rules:
	•	Only posterId and helperId can view that thread and its messages.
	•	Enforced in backend.

Sending messages:
	•	Send text.
	•	Attach image (upload to storage; store URL in imageUrl).
	•	Checkbox/toggle on image send:
	•	“Mark this as proof of work.”
	•	If checked, set isProof = true.

Proof requirement:
	•	If photosRequired = true on the task:
	•	When helper taps “Mark complete”, backend must check:
	•	There exists at least one chatMessage with:
	•	threadId = thread for this task
	•	isProof = true
	•	imageUrl not null
	•	If no such message → block and show error:
	•	“You must upload at least one photo as proof before completing.”

Completion logic:
	•	If proof exists (or if photosRequired = false):
	•	status = "completed"
	•	completedAt = now

Auto-delete chat after 3 days:
	•	On chatThread creation or completion, set expiresAt.
	•	Add scheduled job (cron) that:
	•	Finds all chatThreads where expiresAt < now.
	•	Deletes their chatMessages.
	•	Sets isClosed = true or deletes the thread itself.
	•	In UI:
	•	If isClosed = true or messages are empty and expired:
	•	Show “Chat expired” message.

⸻

9. Manual Payout & Platform Fees

Job price:
	•	price is the total amount for the job (e.g., $10).

Fees:
	•	Platform fee from job: 8% of price.
	•	Payout fee: 2% of price when sending money out to the helper.
	•	Total rake = 10% of job price.

Example (price = $10):
	•	Helper receives $9.00.
	•	Platform earns $1.00 total:
	•	$0.80 as 8% fee from the job.
	•	$0.20 as 2% payout fee when paying the helper.

UI:
	•	Helper Job Detail (after completion):
	•	Show:
	•	“Job amount: $10.00”
	•	“You will receive: $9.00 (10% platform + payout fee)”
	•	“Confirmation number: ABC123 – use this to get paid.”
	•	Poster Job Detail (after completion):
	•	Show:
	•	“Job amount: $10.00”
	•	“Pay your helper $9.00”
	•	“Confirmation number: ABC123 (use this when you send payment).”

Your internal process (manual for now):
	•	You look up task by confirmationCode in your admin.
	•	You send $9.00 to helper via Cash App, Zelle, etc.
	•	You keep $1.00 (10%) as your revenue.

⸻

10. Help & Support – Tickets

Help & Support Screen:
	•	Always reachable from profile/settings or menu.
	•	Must allow the user to:
	•	Create a support ticket.
	•	See a simple list of their tickets.

Create Ticket form:
	•	Fields:
	•	Subject (required)
	•	Message (required)
	•	Optional: related Job (select from “My jobs”)
	•	On submit:
	•	Create SupportTicket with status = "open".

Ticket list:
	•	Show:
	•	Subject
	•	Status (open / in_review / closed)
	•	Created date
	•	Tap ticket: shows full message and any admin response (for now this can be a simple text field you update manually in the DB).

As an end user, I must be able to:
	•	Create a support ticket.
	•	See that the ticket is created and has a status.
	•	Cancel a job.
	•	Accept a job.
	•	Withdraw/deny a job I accepted (helper).
	•	Dispute/deny a job completion if I am the poster (sets status to “disputed”).

⸻

11. Switch to Helper / Poster & Navigation
	•	There must be a reliable way to switch modes that always works:
	•	“Switch to helper” sets userMode = "helper" and routes to Helper home.
	•	“Switch to poster” sets userMode = "poster" and routes to Poster home.
	•	No old role checks should block this (use userMode for UI decisions).

⸻

COMMENTS (for the builder)
	•	Keep the UI as simple and text-based as Craigslist.
	•	The MOST important functional checks from end-user POV:
	1.	I can post a job with a zip code.
	2.	I can see jobs by zip and category in helper mode.
	3.	I can accept a job and then see the full address.
	4.	I can cancel / withdraw a job easily as both poster and helper.
	5.	I can upload proof photos and mark job complete.
	6.	I can see the confirmation number after completion.
	7.	I can create a support ticket, and see it listed with a status.
	8.	Chats auto-expire after 3 days and cannot be accessed afterward.
	•	Fees: total 10% (8% + 2%) is acceptable and not too aggressive for early users.
