✅ ADD THESE FINAL RULES TO THE SPEC

🔵 15. Home Screen / Education Banner (Important Rules)

On the Home Screen and Help Screen, show a permanent informational banner:

**“Posting a job is FREE. Accepting a job is FREE.

You only pay when you CHOOSE a helper.”**

Display the following bullet points:
	•	You are NEVER charged upfront.
	•	Posting a task is 100% free.
	•	Helpers can apply for free.
	•	Payment ONLY happens when:
	•	You select a helper
	•	And the helper accepts
	•	The payment is held securely until both sides mark the job complete.
	•	CityTasks keeps 15% of the total amount (taken from the posted price).
	•	Extra charges (if more work is required) will be added only if the poster agrees.
	•	Tips are optional and go fully to the helper.
	•	If either side disputes the job outcome:
	•	Payment is paused
	•	Both must provide pictures
	•	CityTasks will review photo evidence before releasing payment.

This banner must appear on:
	•	Home screen
	•	Task creation screen (small reminder)
	•	Stripe checkout info panel
	•	Help & Support → Payment Info section

⸻

🔵 16. Critical Payment Rules (MUST IMPLEMENT)

1. Free to post

Posters create unlimited tasks for free.

2. Free to accept

Helpers can send offers for free.

3. Only charged when both accept

Payment ONLY processes when:
	•	Poster selects helper
	•	Helper accepts the job
	•	Stripe Checkout is completed

4. Payment is held until job is done

Funds remain in your connected Stripe account
until BOTH poster and helper confirm:

✔️ “Job Completed”

5. Platform fee is EXACTLY 15%

Taken from the posted total.

Example: $10 job
	•	Poster pays $10
	•	Helper receives $8.50
	•	Platform keeps $1.50
	•	Stripe fee deducted from platform fee

6. Extra charges + tips allowed
	•	Extra charges only added if poster approves
	•	Tip optional
	•	Tips go 100% to helper (recommended)

7. Dispute process

If one party marks “Not Completed”:
	•	Payment is paused
	•	System requests photo evidence from both
	•	CityTasks reviews:
	•	Original job photos
	•	Proof-of-work photos
	•	Chat history
	•	CityTasks decides whether to:
	•	Release funds to helper
	•	Refund poster
	•	Split funds (optional future feature)

8. Final decision recorded in logs

All dispute outcomes must be logged:
	•	Date
	•	Who disputed
	•	Evidence reviewed
	•	Outcome
	•	Amount released
	•	Amount refunded

🔵 17. Where to show this information

Show short version on:
	•	Home Screen (banner)

Show full version on:
	•	Help & Support

Extra charges and tips are optional and shown clearly.”

🟢 THIS IS NOW A COMPLETE, FULLY-PROTECTED, MARKETPLACE SYSTEM

Everything needed to operate safely, legally, and profitably is included.

If you want I can now generate:
	•	Final ToS & Privacy Policy text
	•	Final UI text for Home Screen banner
	•	Backend logic rules
	•	Stripe webhook rules
	•	Complete data model with all fields
	•	The exact code agent needs to build it

Just tell me:
“Generate ToS + Privacy Policy”
or
“Generate the final Task model”Perfect — here is the final, corrected rule, written clearly so your dev, Stripe integration, and app text all use the SAME logic:

⸻

✅ FINAL PAYMENT RULES (USE THIS EXACT WORDING)

1. CityTasks collects 15% of the TOTAL job amount.

This includes:
	•	The original posted budget
	•	Any extra work added later (counter-offers)

2. Tips are ALWAYS 100% paid to the helper.

CityTasks does NOT take ANY fee from tips.

3. Stripe fees come out of CityTasks’ 15% (not the helper’s pay).

Helpers always get their full 85% minus nothing.

⸻

✅ EXAMPLES (100% correct logic)

Job: $10
	•	Poster pays: $10
	•	Platform fee (15%): $1.50
	•	Helper receives: $8.50
	•	Stripe fee comes from the $1.50 (your share)

⸻

Job: $30
	•	Poster pays: $30
	•	Platform keeps: $4.50
	•	Helper gets: $25.50

⸻

Extra Work: +$20

Helper requests extra work, poster agrees:
	•	Poster pays: $20
	•	Platform keeps $3
	•	Helper gets $17

⸻

Tip: +$10

Poster tips after completion:
	•	Helper gets $10
	•	Platform keeps $0
	•	Stripe charges YOU or poster depending on your settings (recommended: absorb it)

⸻

🟢 HOW TO STORE LOGIC IN CODE

Payment 1 (Main Job):

platformFee = totalJobPrice * 0.15;
helperAmount = totalJobPrice - platformFee;

Payment 2 (Extra Work):

extraPlatformFee = extraWorkAmount * 0.15;
extraHelperAmount = extraWorkAmount - extraPlatformFee;

Tip:

tipPlatformFee = 0;
tipHelperAmount = tipAmount;
