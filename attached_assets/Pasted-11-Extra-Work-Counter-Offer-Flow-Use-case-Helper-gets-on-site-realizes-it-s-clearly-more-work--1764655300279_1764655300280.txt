11. Extra Work / Counter-Offer Flow

Use case: Helper gets on site, realizes it’s clearly more work than described.

New rule:
	•	Once a job is accepted and in in_progress, the helper can send ONE or more “Extra Work Requests” (counter offers).

Extra Work Request includes:
	•	Extra description (what changed / why more work)
	•	Extra amount requested (e.g. +$20)
	•	Optional photos

Poster sees:
	•	A clear card in the task:
	•	“Helper requested extra $X for additional work”
	•	Reason text + photos
	•	Two buttons:
	•	Accept extra cost
	•	Decline

If poster accepts:
	•	A separate Stripe Checkout session is created for the extra amount only.
	•	Once extra payment succeeds:
	•	Task keeps same main price + new extraAmountPaid.
	•	Logs record this as extra_charge event.

If poster declines:
	•	Task continues under original price.
	•	If there’s a major disagreement → they can open a Dispute.

Data you’d track (conceptually):
	•	extraWorkRequests[] on the task:
	•	id
	•	requestedByHelperId
	•	amount
	•	reason
	•	status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected" | "paid"
	•	stripeCheckoutSessionId?

Only accepted + paid extras affect payout.

12. Tip Function

Use case: Poster wants to reward good work after the job is done.

When tip can be added:
	•	After task is marked completed, but before it is fully “archived”.
	•	Shown as a simple prompt:
	•	“Leave a tip?”
	•	Suggested buttons: $5, $10, $20, Custom

Flow:
	1.	Poster selects tip → Stripe Checkout opens for tip only.
	2.	After successful payment:
	•	Tip is stored in task as tipAmount.
	•	Tip is linked to helper and to Stripe payment.
	3.	Helper sees tip in their history (“Tip: $X”).

Platform fee on tips (your choice):
	•	Either:
	•	0% fee on tips (all to helper – good for marketing), or
	•	Small fee (e.g. 5%)
	•	Whatever you choose, it’s just:
	•	tipPlatformFeeAmount
	•	tipHelperAmount

Data you’d track:
	•	tipAmount on task
	•	tipStripePaymentIntentId
	•	tipCreatedAt

13. Logging (extended for both)

In your logs, for each job you’ll now see extra events:
	•	extra_work_requested
	•	extra_work_accepted
	•	extra_work_paid
	•	tip_added

So from your dashboard you can always see:
	•	Original price
	•	Extra charges (if any)
	•	Tip (if any)
	•	Total cost to poster
	•	Total owed to helper
