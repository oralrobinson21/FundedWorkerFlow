	•	Filtering jobs
	•	Canceling jobs
	•	Messaging

You can copy-paste this directly into your agent or dev.

✅ FINAL COMPLETE REQUIREMENTS (COPY–PASTE)

This is the full specification for the app:

⸻

🔵 1. Categories (13 total)

Every task MUST be assigned one of the following:
	1.	Cleaning & Housekeeping
	2.	Moving & Heavy Lifting
	3.	Delivery & Pickups
	4.	Handyman & Repairs
	5.	Yardwork & Outdoors
	6.	Errands & Small Tasks
	7.	Tech Help
	8.	Pet Care
	9.	Car Help
	10.	Home Organizing
	11.	Babysitting & Senior Help
	12.	Beauty & Personal Services
	13.	Other

⸻

🔵 2. Posting Flow (Poster Mode)

When creating a task, the poster MUST fill in:
	•	Category (dropdown from the 13 above)
	•	Task title
	•	Task description
	•	Zip code
	•	Area / neighborhood description
	•	Full address (hidden until acceptance)
	•	Budget (minimum $7 enforced)
	•	Tools Required? (switch)
	•	Tools Provided? (switch)
	•	Photo upload (optional, but recommended)

The system must:
	•	Validate the $7 minimum
	•	Validate all required fields
	•	Save the task
	•	Add it to the global task list
	•	Show the poster their task under “My Posts”
	•	Allow poster to cancel the task at any time if not accepted
	•	Once accepted, poster can no longer cancel unless dispute is opened

⸻

🔵 3. Searching & Filtering (Helper Mode)

Helpers MUST be able to filter tasks by:
	•	All categories (default)
	•	A single category
	•	Zip code radius
	•	Tools required
	•	Tools provided

Search example filters:
	•	Show ALL tasks (unfiltered)
	•	Show only Cleaning & Housekeeping
	•	Show only Handyman tasks requiring tools
	•	Show only tasks in 10457 zip

This guarantees scalability even with 100,000+ tasks posted.

⸻

🔵 4. Accepting Tasks (Helper Mode)

When the helper taps a task:

They MUST see:
	•	Category
	•	Task title
	•	Description
	•	Zip code
	•	Tools required? (yes/no)
	•	Tools provided? (yes/no)
	•	Budget
	•	Poster’s profile photo
	•	“About the poster” (name + rating in future)

Helper must submit:
	•	A short note explaining their experience
	•	(Optional) expected arrival time

After submitting:
	•	Poster sees all helper offers
	•	Poster chooses 1 helper
	•	System triggers Stripe Checkout (poster pays)
	•	Stripe webhook creates the chat thread
	•	Task disappears from public list

⸻

🔵 5. Messaging (after acceptance)

Once a helper is chosen & payment is successful:
	•	Chat thread is created
	•	Both sides can send messages
	•	Both sides can send photos (proof)
	•	Chat auto-deletes after 3 days
	•	Task shows “In progress”

Helper sees full address ONLY after acceptance.

⸻

🔵 6. Cancellation Rules

Poster can cancel:
	•	Before helper is selected (immediate)
	•	After payment (only if dispute is opened)

Helper can cancel:
	•	Before arriving
	•	Poster gets refunded manually (you handle)

Cancel button must exist on:
	•	Poster: TaskDetailScreen
	•	Helper: AcceptedTaskDetailScreen

⸻

🔵 7. Profile Photo Requirement

All users must upload a profile photo before:
	•	Posting a task
	•	Sending an offer
	•	Messaging
	•	Accepting a task

This is required for safety so posters know who is coming to their home.

System must block continuation with:

"Please upload a profile photo to continue."


⸻

🔵 8. Logging & Records

You want detailed logs. Best approach:

Store logs in your backend DB + Stripe dashboard.

DB logs should record:
	•	Task created
	•	Helper offer submitted
	•	Poster selection
	•	Payment initiated
	•	Payment success
	•	Chat created
	•	Task in progress
	•	Task completed
	•	Disputes
	•	Cancellations
	•	Payout released

Stripe will also keep:
	•	Payment records
	•	Payout logs
	•	Fees
	•	Platform earnings

This gives you full protection in case of disputes or fraud.

⸻

🔵 9. Stripe Logic

Platform keeps: 15% fee

Helper receives: 85%

Stripe Connect Express flow:
	1.	User posts a job
	2.	Helper submits offer
	3.	Poster selects helper
	4.	Stripe Checkout opens
	5.	Payment succeeds
	6.	Chat opens
	7.	Helper does work
	8.	Poster marks complete
	9.	You manually release payout
	10.	Logs record everything

⸻

If you want, I can now generate:

👉 A TypeScript model file for all categories

👉 A UI screen layout for filters

👉 The backend database schema

👉 The full AppContext updated to support all fields

Just say:
“Generate the TypeScript schema”
or
“Generate the filter UI”
or
“Generate full AppContext with all new fields.”
