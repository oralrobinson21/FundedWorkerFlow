Got you — let’s lock this in so the app is simple like Craigslist but with your safety + manual payout flow.

I’ll treat this as the “final spec” you can give a dev or another AI agent to make everything 100%:

⸻

1. Core Roles & Main Screens

Roles (same account, two modes)
	•	Poster (Customer): creates jobs.
	•	Helper (Worker): accepts jobs.

A single user can toggle between “I need help” and “I’m helping”.

Main screens
	1.	Mode Selector / Home
	•	Big toggle/buttons:
	•	“I need help (Post a job)”
	•	“I’m helping (Find work)”
	•	Current mode saved in app state (e.g., userMode = "poster" or "helper").
	2.	Category Screen (shared)
	•	After choosing a mode:
	•	Poster mode: “What do you need help with?”
	•	Helper mode: “What type of work are you looking for?”
	•	Categories example:
	•	Cleaning
	•	Moving
	•	Handyman
	•	Groceries
	•	Other
	•	Tap category → next screen is different per mode:
	•	Poster → Create Job screen
	•	Helper → Job List screen filtered by that category.
	3.	Create Job Screen (Poster)
	4.	Job List Screen (Helper)
	5.	Job Detail Screen
	6.	Messages (one thread per accepted job)
	7.	My Jobs (Poster & Helper views)
	8.	Help & Support

⸻

2. Data Model (Backend)

users
	•	id
	•	name
	•	phone
	•	defaultZipCode
	•	createdAt

tasks

Required to support all your rules:
	•	id
	•	title
	•	description
	•	category (string/enum)
	•	zipCode (string, required)
	•	areaDescription (optional, e.g. “Bronx – 170th & Grand Concourse”)
	•	fullAddress (optional but recommended, only shown after accept)
	•	price (number)
	•	status ("open" | "accepted" | "completed" | "canceled")
	•	posterId (FK → users.id)
	•	helperId (nullable FK → users.id)
	•	confirmationCode (string, unique, e.g. 6–8 chars)
	•	photosRequired (bool, default true)
	•	createdAt
	•	acceptedAt (nullable)
	•	completedAt (nullable)
	•	canceledAt (nullable)
	•	canceledBy ("poster" | "helper" | null)

chatThreads
	•	id
	•	taskId (FK → tasks.id)
	•	posterId
	•	helperId
	•	createdAt
	•	expiresAt (3 days after completion or acceptance — see below)
	•	isClosed (bool)

chatMessages
	•	id
	•	threadId
	•	senderId

	•	imageUrl (nullable)
	•	isProof (bool, default false)
	•	createdAt

Privacy rule: only posterId and helperId can access a chatThread and its chatMessages.

⸻

3. Job Posting Flow (Poster)

Step 1: Mode & Category
	•	User taps “I need help” → Category screen.
	•	Select category → goes to Create Job.

Step 2: Create Job screen fields

Required:
	•	Title (short)
	•	Description (what needs to be done)
	•	Category (pre-selected)
	•	Zip Code (required)
	•	Price / Budget

Optional but recommended:
	•	Area / Neighborhood
	•	Helper sees this before accepting.
	•	Full Address
	•	Only helper sees it after accepting.
	•	Photos Required toggle
	•	Default ON — “Require photo proof when completed.”

Validation
	•	Do not let them submit unless:
	•	title, description, zipCode, price filled.
	•	For in-person tasks: also require fullAddress.

On submit
	•	Create task:
	•	status = "open"
	•	confirmationCode = random unique string
	•	Poster can immediately post multiple jobs; no limit:
	•	After posting, show:
	•	Button: “Post another job”
	•	Button: “View my jobs”

⸻

4. Finding Jobs (Helper Mode)

Step 1: Mode & Category
	•	User taps “I’m helping”.
	•	Category screen: choose what type of work they want.

Step 2: Zip filter UI

At the top of the Job List:
	•	Text field: Zip code
	•	Auto-filled from user.defaultZipCode if available.
	•	Optional “Search radius” dropdown (e.g., 0 / 5 / 10 miles) — can add later.
	•	Button: “Update results”.

Backend filter

Query tasks where:
	•	status = "open"
	•	category = selected category
	•	zipCode matches filter (or within radius, if you implement distance).

Job List card (Helper view, before acceptance)

Show:
	•	Title
	•	Category
	•	Price
	•	Zip code
	•	Area / Neighborhood (if provided)
	•	Basic timing info
Do not show:
	•	fullAddress.

Tap card → Job Detail (before acceptance).

⸻

5. Job Detail: Before vs After Acceptance

Before acceptance (Helper)

Show:
	•	Title
	•	Description
	•	Category
	•	Price
	•	Zip code
	•	Area / Neighborhood
	•	Button: “Accept job”

Hide:
	•	fullAddress.

On Accept job

When helper taps “Accept job”:
	•	Set:
	•	task.status = "accepted"
	•	task.helperId = currentUser.id
	•	task.acceptedAt = now
	•	Create a chatThread for this task:
	•	posterId = task.posterId
	•	helperId = currentUser.id
	•	expiresAt = now + 3 days (or now + 3 days after completion if you prefer)
	•	Show success:
	•	“You accepted this job. The exact address and chat are now available.”

After acceptance (Helper view)

Now Job Detail shows:
	•	All previous info +
	•	Full Address, with lock icon and label:
	•	🔒 Exact address (visible only to you and the customer)
	•	Button: “Open chat & upload proof”
	•	Button: “Mark complete” (after proof photo uploaded)
	•	Button: “Cancel / Withdraw” (if you want helpers to back out)

Poster view (for accepted job)
	•	Sees both area + fullAddress.
	•	Sees helper info.
	•	Sees confirmationCode.
	•	Has:
	•	Button: “Open chat”
	•	Button: “Cancel job”

⸻

6. Easy Job Cancellation

Poster cancellation

On My Jobs or Job Detail:
	•	For status = "open" or "accepted":
	•	Show “Cancel job” button.
	•	On tap:
	•	Ask for reason (optional).
	•	Update:
	•	status = "canceled"
	•	canceledAt = now
	•	canceledBy = "poster"
	•	If there’s a helper:
	•	Notify helper that job is canceled.

Helper withdrawal (optional but recommended)

If helper wants to back out:
	•	Show “Withdraw from job” button while status = "accepted".
	•	On tap:
	•	Option A (simple): mark as canceled:
	•	status = "canceled"
	•	canceledBy = "helper"
	•	Option B (more flexible): reopen the job:
	•	helperId = null
	•	status = "open"

For now, Option A (simple) is fine.

⸻

7. Manual Payout via Confirmation Number

You’re not automating Stripe yet, so:

On task creation
	•	Generate confirmationCode (e.g., 6–8 alphanumeric).

On completion (app behavior)
	1.	Helper:
	•	Uploads required photo (proof).
	•	Taps “Mark complete”.
	•	App checks:
	•	If photosRequired is true, require at least one chatMessage with:
	•	imageUrl not null
	•	isProof = true.
	•	If OK:
	•	Set task.status = "completed".
	•	completedAt = now.
	2.	Both sides see the confirmation:
	•	Helper Job Detail:
	•	“Job completed. Your confirmation number: XYZ123. Share this with the customer to get paid.”
	•	Poster Job Detail:
	•	“Job completed. Pay your helper using confirmation number: XYZ123.”

Your offline process
	•	You use confirmation code + job ID in your own records (spreadsheet, bank app, etc.) to send money via Cash App/Zelle/etc. until you’re big enough to automate payouts.

⸻

8. Messaging + Photos + Auto-Delete After 3 Days

Creation
	•	A chatThread is automatically created when a task is accepted.

Access
	•	Only posterId and helperId can open it.
	•	Enforce this on backend:
	•	if currentUser.id not in (posterId, helperId) → deny.

Messages

Each message can contain:
	•	Text only
	•	Image only
	•	Text + Image
	•	Optional isProof flag.

For proof:
	•	On upload, show checkbox/toggle:
	•	“Mark this photo as proof of completion.”
	•	Store isProof = true for that message.

Auto-delete after 3 days

Set up a scheduled backend job (e.g., cron / scheduled function):
	1.	Every night:
	•	Find any chatThreads where:
	•	expiresAt < now
	2.	For each:
	•	Delete or hard-truncate messages:
	•	Delete chatMessages first.
	•	Then set isClosed = true or delete the thread.
	•	Make sure UI:
	•	Shows “Chat expired” if user tries to open.

How you define expiresAt:
	•	Simple version:
	•	expiresAt = acceptedAt + 3 days.
	•	Better version:
	•	expiresAt = completedAt + 3 days (if completed).
	•	If never completed, still expire based on acceptedAt.

Pick one, document it, and implement.

9. “Switch to Helper” Fix

Your current issue: “Switch to helper not working”.

Make sure:
	1.	There’s a single userMode in global state (context/store):
	•	"poster" or "helper".
	2.	The “Switch to helper” button:
	•	Actually calls something like:
setUserMode("helper");
	•	Then navigates to the correct home screen:
	•	navigation.navigate("HelperHome"); or equivalent.
	3.	UI reflects mode:
	•	Helper mode home shows:
	•	“Find work” + Category grid.
	•	Poster mode home shows:
	•	“Post a job” + “My jobs”.

Verify that:
	•	No old code is hiding the helper view behind a wrong condition (if (role === "helper") if you’re now using a mode toggle instead of server role.

⸻

10. Help & Support Fix

Your note: “help and support not working”.

Make it dead simple:
	1.	Help & Support screen (route exists in navigation):
	•	Section 1: “Contact us”
	•	Show a simple form:
	•	Subject
	•	Message
	•	Optional screenshot upload
	•	On submit:
	•	Send to your support email or store in supportTickets table.
	•	Section 2: “Quick help”
	•	3–5 short Q&As (static for now):
	•	How do I cancel a job?
	•	When should I pay my helper?
	•	Why can’t I see the address yet?
	2.	Wire up navigation:
	•	In your profile/settings:
	•	“Help & Support” → navigation.navigate("Support");
	3.	Keep it minimal:
	•	Even just a mailto link + static FAQ is enough in v1.

⸻

11. “Ultimate 100% Checklist”

Here’s the compressed checklist you can hand to a dev/agent:
	1.	Roles & Navigation
	•	Implement userMode switch (poster/helper).
	•	Mode-based home → Category screen → next screen depending on mode.
	2.	Job Data Model
	•	Ensure tasks has:
	•	zipCode (required), areaDescription, fullAddress, status, posterId, helperId, confirmationCode, timestamps, etc.
	3.	Job Posting
	•	Require zipCode in the form.
	•	Allow multiple jobs per user.
	•	Generate confirmationCode at creation.
	4.	Job Discovery
	•	Helper can filter by zip.
	•	Job List only shows area + zip (no fullAddress).
	•	Job Detail (before accept) still hides fullAddress.
	5.	Acceptance + Address Privacy
	•	On accept:
	•	Set helperId, status = "accepted".
	•	Create chatThread.
	•	After accept:
	•	Show fullAddress only to that helper + poster.
	•	Keep it hidden everywhere else.
	6.	Cancellation
	•	Poster can cancel from Job Detail/My Jobs.
	•	Optionally allow helper withdrawal.
	•	Update status, canceledAt, canceledBy.
	7.	Messaging & Proof
	•	One chatThread per accepted job.
	•	Only poster/helper can see it.
	•	Allow image messages; support isProof.
	•	Require at least one proof image before marking job completed (if photosRequired true).
	8.	Completion + Confirmation Code
	•	When marking complete:
	•	Validate proof.
	•	Set status = "completed".
	•	Show confirmationCode to both sides.
	9.	Chat Auto-Delete
	•	Set expiresAt on threads.
	•	Scheduled job deletes messages/threads 3 days after expiry.
	•	UI displays “Chat expired” gracefully.
	10.	Help & Support

	•	Add functioning “Help & Support” screen + navigation.
	•	At least one contact method & mini FAQ.

If you want, next message you can paste your current navigation code (where “switch to helper” and “help & support” live), and I’ll rewrite those specific pieces in code so they match this spec exactly.
