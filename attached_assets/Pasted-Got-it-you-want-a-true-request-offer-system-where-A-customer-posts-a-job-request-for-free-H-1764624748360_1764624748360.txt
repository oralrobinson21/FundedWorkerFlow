Got it — you want a true request/offer system where:
	•	A customer posts a job request for free
	•	Helpers send offers/notes
	•	The customer chooses a helper
	•	ONLY THEN money is charged
	•	The job officially becomes active and moves to the acceptance/working stage

This is a major improvement.
Here is the full system rewritten clearly and ready to copy-paste into your builder.

⸻

✅ Updated System: Request → Offers → Accept → Charge → Start Job

Below is the complete flow and the backend changes required.

⸻

🚦 1. Posting a Job = FREE (no card charged yet)

Customer fills out:
	•	Title
	•	Description
	•	Category
	•	Zip code (required)
	•	Area / neighborhood (optional)
	•	Price they’re willing to pay
	•	Full address (still hidden until helper is chosen)

System stores the job with:

status = "requested"

No helper assigned yet.

No money charged yet.

Helpers cannot accept it yet — they can only send offers.

⸻

🧾 2. Helpers Send Offers (with a note/message)

For every job with:

status = "requested"

Helpers can tap “Send Offer” and fill:
	•	A short note (required)
	•	Optional proposed price (if you allow bidding)
	•	Optional photo if needed for clarity

This creates a JobOffer entry:

jobOffer {
  id
  taskId
  helperId
  note
  proposedPrice (optional)
  createdAt
  status = "pending"
}

The poster sees all incoming offers.

⸻

👉 3. Customer Chooses a Helper

Once the customer picks a helper:
	•	They tap “Choose Helper”
	•	Then they are asked to enter payment info
	•	Payment is NOT captured yet, only authorized

Stripe Setup:
	•	Use Stripe Payment Intent with capture_method=manual
	•	Authorizes funds
	•	Does NOT charge yet
	•	You capture the payment when job is marked completed
	•	OR capture partial upfront (optional)

After payment authorization:
	•	Task changes to:

status = "accepted"
helperId = chosenHelper.id
acceptedAt = now

	•	A chat thread is created
	•	Full address is shown to that helper only
	•	Other helper offers are marked:

status = "declined"


⸻

💳 4. Only charge AFTER job is assigned

Nothing is charged when the post is created.

Charge timeline:
	1.	Poster selects helper → Stripe authorizes the amount
	2.	Job is completed + proof verified → Stripe captures the payment
	3.	Your platform keeps 10% or 12%
	4.	Stripe payout releases money to helper’s external account

⸻

🛠 5. Job Lifecycle (Rewritten)

Requested

Job posted, waiting for helper offers.

Offers

Helpers send notes, optional pricing.

Accepted

Poster selects helper and payment method is authorized.

In Progress

Helper sees full address, starts job.

Completed

Helper uploads proof → Poster approves (or system auto-approves) → Stripe captures payment.

Paid Out

Helper receives payout (minus your fees).

Canceled

Poster cancels before choosing helper = FREE
Poster cancels after assigning helper (optional rules)

⸻

🧱 6. Required New Tables

JobOffers

{
  id,
  taskId,
  helperId,
  note,
  proposedPrice,
  status ("pending" | "declined" | "accepted"),
  createdAt
}

Payments

{
  id,
  taskId,
  paymentIntentId,
  amount,
  status ("authorized" | "captured" | "refunded" | "failed"),
  createdAt
}

You don’t need to store card data — Stripe handles that.

⸻

🔒 7. Privacy Rules Stay the Same

Helpers DO NOT see the exact address until:
	•	Customer selects them
	•	Payment is authorized
	•	Job status becomes accepted

⸻

💬 8. Chat Logic Still Works

Chat thread created only after a helper is chosen.

Chat auto-deletes after 3 days.

Proof image still required for “Mark Completed”.

⸻

💸 9. Fees Still Apply (10% or 12%)

Example for $30:
	•	Helper receives $26.40 if you use 12%
	•	You earn $3.60
	•	Stripe fees deducted only when a payment is captured
	•	Nothing is charged during job request/offers phase

⸻

🧍‍♂️ YOU asked:

“Do you think this is fair or should I do 16%?”

My answer:
	•	For low-value tasks: 10%
	•	For mid-value tasks ($30–$100): 12%
	•	For premium services: you can go up to 15–18%

But starting with 10–12% is the sweet spot for growth.
16% is too high for a new marketplace unless you offer insurance & instant payouts.
