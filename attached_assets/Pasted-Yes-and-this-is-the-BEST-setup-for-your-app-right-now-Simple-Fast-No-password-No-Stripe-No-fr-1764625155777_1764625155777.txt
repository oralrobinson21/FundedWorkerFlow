Yes — and this is the BEST setup for your app right now.
Simple. Fast. No password. No Stripe. No friction.

✅ Recommended Login Method for Your Marketplace MVP

Email-only login with a 6-digit verification code
(aka “passwordless magic link / OTP login”)

✔️ FLOW:
	1.	User enters their email
	2.	App sends a 6-digit code to their inbox
	3.	User types the code
	4.	They are logged in

No password.
No username.
No forgotten password issues.
No Stripe or payment info required.

✔️ WHY THIS IS IDEAL FOR YOUR APP
	•	Very low friction onboarding
	•	Craigslist-style simple
	•	Works perfect for both poster & helper
	•	You can store:
	•	accountNumber
	•	phone (optional)
	•	defaultZipCode
	•	userMode preference
	•	Easy to build
	•	Secure enough for the type of app you’re making
	•	No payment credentials stored = fewer legal/security complications

🔧 WHAT YOU GIVE YOUR BUILDER (copy/paste)

AUTH METHOD:
Use passwordless email login with a verification code.

Flow:
	1.	User enters email
	2.	Send them a 6-digit OTP code
	3.	User enters the code
	4.	If it matches → create/get user → log them in

User object after login must contain:
	•	id
	•	email
	•	accountNumber (auto-generated on first signup)
	•	defaultZipCode (user sets this once)
	•	name (optional)
	•	createdAt

No password fields at all.

No Stripe login or Stripe customer creation required.

🧱 WHAT TO CONFIRM WITH BUILDER

Make sure the builder understands:

✔️ We are NOT using Stripe Auth
✔️ We do NOT need passwords
✔️ Every user must get an accountNumber on first login
✔️ After login they land on Mode Selector screen
✔️ UserMode is saved in AppContext
✔️ Verification codes expire in 5–10 minutes
✔️ If user enters wrong code → “Invalid code”

⸻

📌 ONE MORE THING (IMPORTANT)

Make sure users ALSO enter their phone number the first time they log in.

Why?
Because you will need:
	•	Phone for communication
	•	Phone if they lose access to email
	•	Phone for future notifications (SMS)

But this is after login, not during login.

⸻

✔️ FINAL CONFIRMATION

To answer your question clearly:

YES — login should be email + verification code only, nothing else.

This keeps your MVP ultra-simple and friction-free.

If you want, I can write:
	•	The exact JSON for the user table
	•	The exact login UI text
	•	The exact backend login logic (pseudocode or real code)

Just tell me.
