You did a good job calling out that this is a major refactor.
Let’s simplify to make this realistic for MVP and remove Stripe entirely.

🔴 IMPORTANT – REMOVE STRIPE COMPLETELY FOR NOW
	1.	Remove all Stripe-specific logic:
	•	No card screens
	•	No payment intents, capture, refund, or payout calls
	•	No “enter credit card” flow at job creation or acceptance
	2.	We are doing manual payouts only in this version:
	•	Platform does not move money
	•	We only show: job price, confirmation code, and helper’s accountNumber
	•	Admin/user sends money offline (Zelle, Cash App, bank, etc.)

⸻

🧾 User Model – Add / Use accountNumber

All users already have an account number. Use it as an internal payout ID.

User fields (minimum needed):
	•	id
	•	name
	•	phone
	•	defaultZipCode
	•	accountNumber  ← required
	•	createdAt

accountNumber can be whatever the app already uses (e.g. based on date + sequence).
Just make sure:
	•	It’s saved for each user
	•	It’s readable in the UI where needed (My Jobs, Job Detail, payout instructions)

⸻

🧱 Task / Job Model – FINAL VERSION (no Stripe fields)

Keep/ensure these fields exist for Task:
	•	id
	•	title
	•	description
	•	category
	•	zipCode (required)
	•	areaDescription (optional)
	•	fullAddress (optional, only visible to poster + accepted helper)
	•	price (number)
	•	status:
	•	"requested" – job posted, waiting for offers
	•	"accepted" – poster chose a helper
	•	"in_progress" – work started
	•	"completed" – work done, ready to pay
	•	"canceled" – canceled by someone
	•	"disputed" – poster is disputing completion
	•	posterId
	•	helperId (nullable)
	•	confirmationCode (unique string per job)
	•	photosRequired (bool, default true)
	•	createdAt
	•	acceptedAt (nullable)
	•	completedAt (nullable)
	•	canceledAt (nullable)
	•	canceledBy ("poster" | "helper" | null)

No paymentIntentId, no Stripe-related fields.

📨 JobOffers Model – For request → offer → accept flow

Add a JobOffer type/table:
	•	id
	•	taskId
	•	helperId
	•	note (string, required)
	•	proposedPrice (optional – for now you can ignore and just use task.price)
	•	status:
	•	"pending"
	•	"accepted"
	•	"declined"
	•	createdAt

Rules:
	•	Helpers can only create offers when:
	•	task.status = "requested"
	•	Poster sees a list of offers on the job detail screen (poster view).
	•	When poster selects a helper:
	•	Set task.helperId = chosenHelperId
	•	Set task.status = "accepted"
	•	Set acceptedAt = now
	•	Mark that offer status = "accepted"
	•	Mark all other offers for that task as status = "declined"
	•	Create a chat thread between poster and chosen helper
	•	Reveal fullAddress to the chosen helper

⸻

🌐 User Modes – Poster vs Helper

You already started refactoring from roles to userMode. Please complete this:
	•	userMode: "poster" | "helper" in AppContext
	•	Functions:
	•	setUserMode("poster")
	•	setUserMode("helper")

Navigation:
	1.	Home / Mode Selector screen
	•	Two big buttons:
	•	“I need help” → sets userMode = "poster" and navigates to Category screen
	•	“I’m helping” → sets userMode = "helper" and navigates to Category screen
	2.	Category screen
	•	Shared for both modes
	•	On press:
	•	If userMode = "poster" → go to CreateTaskScreen
	•	If userMode = "helper" → go to JobListScreen (filtered by category + zip)

⸻

🧾 CreateTaskScreen (Poster – Job Request)

Update/Create CreateTaskScreen:

Fields:
	•	Title (required)
	•	Description (required)
	•	Category (required – from category selection)
	•	Zip code (required)
	•	Area / neighborhood (optional)
	•	Full address (optional but recommended; shown only after accept)
	•	Price (required)
	•	Photos required toggle (default ON)

On submit:
	•	Create a task with:
	•	status = "requested"
	•	posterId = currentUser.id
	•	helperId = null
	•	confirmationCode = random unique string
	•	No Stripe calls
	•	Show:
	•	“Your request is posted. Helpers can now send offers.”

Poster can post multiple jobs; nothing blocks that.

⸻

🔍 JobListScreen (Helper – Browse Requests)

For helpers:
	•	Top of screen:
	•	Zip code input (required to filter)
	•	“Update results” button
	•	Query:
	•	status = "requested"
	•	category = selectedCategory
	•	zipCode matches input (or simple equality for now)
	•	Each job card shows:
	•	Title
	•	Category
	•	Description snippet
	•	Zip code
	•	Area / neighborhood
	•	Price

Job detail (helper) when status = “requested”:
	•	Show job info (no fullAddress).
	•	Button: “Send offer”

Send offer UI:
	•	Require a note (textarea).
	•	Optionally allow different proposedPrice (MVP can ignore and just use job price).
	•	On submit:
	•	Create JobOffer with:
	•	status = "pending"

⸻

👤 Job Detail – Poster View (Choosing Helper)

If currentUser is the poster and status = "requested":
	•	Show job info + list of offers:
	•	Each offer: helper name, note, createdAt
	•	For each offer:
	•	Button: “Choose this helper”

On “Choose this helper”:
	•	Set:
	•	task.helperId = helperId
	•	task.status = "accepted"
	•	acceptedAt = now
	•	Update JobOffers:
	•	Selected: status = "accepted"
	•	Others: status = "declined"
	•	Create ChatThread for this task between poster & helper
	•	Reveal fullAddress to helper on their Job Detail screen

No payment logic here. No Stripe.

💬 Chat + Proof + Completion (No Stripe)

You already added ChatThread and ChatMessage types. Please finish implementing:

ChatThread:
	•	id
	•	taskId
	•	posterId
	•	helperId
	•	createdAt
	•	expiresAt (3 days after completed or accepted)
	•	isClosed (bool)

ChatMessage:
	•	id
	•	threadId
	•	senderId
	•	text (optional)
	•	imageUrl (optional)
	•	isProof (bool, default false)
	•	createdAt

Rules:
	•	Only posterId and helperId can access a chatThread.
	•	When a helper is chosen:
	•	Create a thread (if not existing).
	•	In UI, allow:
	•	Text messages
	•	Image upload
	•	A toggle/checkbox to mark an image as proof (isProof = true)
